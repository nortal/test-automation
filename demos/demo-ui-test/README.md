# Test Automation UI demo

A simple demo that executes Selenide tests against https://testpages.herokuapp.com

com.nortal.test.demo.TestPageBehavioralTest test is junit5 entrypoint class and can be executed manually.

**Demo report is accessible from:** build/allure-report/index.html
Note: To avoid CORS issues use http server. (IntelliJ can provide one OOTB) \
An alternative would be to enable direct report serving through test-automation.report.allure.serve-report.enabled=true
