# Test Automation UI demo

A simple demo that executes Selenide tests against https://testpages.herokuapp.com

Test `com.nortal.test.demo.TestPageBehavioralTest` is JUnit5 entrypoint class and can be executed manually.

Demo report is accessible from: `build/allure-report/index.html`

Note: To avoid CORS issues use http server. (IntelliJ can provide one OOTB) \
An alternative would be to enable direct report serving through `test-automation.report.allure.serve-report.enabled=true`
