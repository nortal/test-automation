# The instructions under End-of-line conversion at the following link were used to normalize
# the repository. The actual steps are also listed just below the link.

# Official git instructions: http://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes

# $ rm .git/index     # Remove the index to force Git to
# $ git reset         # re-scan the working directory
# $ git status        # Show files that will be normalized
# $ git add -u

# For completeness, a reference to instructions provided by GitHub is included, but they only
# normalize about 10% of the files that the official git-scm.org instructions were able to fix.

# GitHub's instructions: https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings

# This portion of the file was created using a list of extensions generated by running the
# following command:

# find . -type f | grep -v '.git'| perl -pe 's/.*[\.\/](.+)/\1/g'|sort|uniq -c|sort -n

# Explicitly declare text files we want to always be normalized and converted 
# to native line endings on checkout.
